- Problem

1. Event organisers, DJ are a brand as artists not the events => we will make them like an influencer where people can actively follow and see what's the next event etc
2. Small organisers are not promoted enough for their potentials, big event take over all. => not everyone wants be in packed events, we should help promotes small but storng organisers to be visible better and found for right people
3. Not enough details in personalised party filter => age group, vibe, etc..
4. People can not tell enough by mere description or some photos, they end up get dissapointed => show live atmosphere with people participate to post live photos, live video clips, live chats, etc..
5. There are absolute tastes for parties depending on people and that is not "popularity itself" at all popularity is just an another filter just that current competittor does not seem to know, they just sell tickets
6. give options as request invitation instead of ticket only : able to request and send invitations by organiser pre-check or weather to accept, there are exclusive events and the spectrum of that exclusivity is vary depending on many factors, no event apps are discounting those details
7. provide free event mangement platform for private parties too, this will help user growth
8. event platform includes staff managements, to see who are temporarly working for how long, doing what, and where
9. provide VIP lists for event to users, and what VIP means for user based on organiser's tastes,
10. The UX can be vastly customised from festivals to pubcrawl, pubcrawl for instancae, usually is one or few people managing and they have timeline of places such as bar or clubs which we can show in UX so people do not rely on multiple different contact, partyx one app can solve all this, from payment to oragnising and marketing, managing guestlist and planning spot all dynamically
11. So based on event type they choose we offer customised UX, this way we keep it simplest and easiest possible while it should truly help organisers to be more productive and efficient, ulitmately make them more succsseuful that is practical goal of partyx more than just making things authentic
